# Request for Comments- SCN Governance Structure

Motivation: RobJ from NYCmesh and I talked about coordination problems where project leaders get exhausted feeling like there’s no one to help on projects, while others (new people) feel like there’s no entry/path to helping out.

# Overall Leadership structure proposed:

Elected leadership “Board” made up of **5-9** **currently active** “*Technical*,” “*Social*,” and “*Techno-Social*” “**Leads**.” At least 2 categories of Leads must be present on the Board at all times.  
There is an additional Chair of the board, to oversee the implementation and processes of the board. 

**Functions:**

- authorize and support (or kill) projects and tasks that need hands or are being worked on, authorize time/resource use and spending of money  
- maintain a list of active projects  
- monitor project statuses

**Requirements:** 

- Default term length: one quarter (3 months), counting from their starting month (term could start after vote-in at any monthly community meeting). Term limit 7 of every 8 consecutive quarters.  
- All board members MUST be responsive to email and/or Discord for decision processes (explicit abstain is acceptable if no input desired). If a board member misses 3 or more decision windows, they are off the board.

## 3 “tracks” for becoming a Lead: Technical, Social, Techno-social

Individuals may fully hold both “Technical” and “Social” Lead roles (and this is highly encouraged).

### **Technical**

*Technical leads* have done 10+ technical and infrastructure projects/tasks such as installs, repairs, mentoring/teaching. Their role is to teach other technical volunteers and lead or mentor technical projects.

Possible technical project tasks:  
–teaching technical skills/topics in any SCN event/workshop/class  
–site or user installs  
–repairs, expansions, upgrades  
–taking technical service/maintenance calls  
–participate in weekly community tech support

### **Social**

*Social leads* have participated in 10+ social and community organizing projects/tasks such as community meetings, outreach workshops, support calls, nonprofit administrative roles, internal governance and community building, and external community outreach. Can include hyper-local events (e.g. organizing a neighborhood or site-based meetup). Their role is to teach/mentor other social volunteers and lead or coordinate social and community organizing projects/tasks.

Possible social project tasks:  
–applying for a grant  
–scheduling installs/coordinating site visits  
–managing partnership with another org  
–teaching or helping to coordinate any SCN event/workshop/class  
–social media and print media for SCN  
–making forms to help organize volunteers/governance processes  
–participate in weekly community tech support

### **Techno-social**

*Techno-social leads* have done 6+ from each category (Technical and Social). 

#### Process:

- Must participate in 1+ project tasks/activities within the past year (or donate $20) to maintain “active” volunteer status ([activity completion form here](https://forms.gle/PPC18aMLEiJ4hLKv5))  
- When you’ve done your 10+ (or 12+), fill out a [lead certification form](https://forms.gle/whsmR31BkydWXY8d6) listing out your fulfilled tasks as a record (and get a crimp kit or other desired swag from a Board member once they approve you).

## Board Elections:

- All “Leads” get to vote for people to be elected to either board (and can also vote to remove a lead from either board).   
- Chair of the board organizes agendas for community meetings  
  - Any board member can propose election/removal beforehand to Chair

## Board Decisions:

### Project Proposals:

\-Projects can be proposed by anyone involved in the network (board member, volunteer, Digital Steward, partner org, user, etc.), but by default they need approval by the whole board.  
\- Every proposed project has a champion and a deputy also in our community who signs on to the project to assist. Deputy is responsible for the project in the absence of the champion. Stronger projects will have teams that include other people, not just the two required. Additionally, each proposal has a board member sponsor who presents the project to the rest of the board for approval.  
\- Info needed for proposals: Reason, timeline, budget, sign offs from required team members and board sponsor.  
\- Each project team has decision autonomy once approved, but have to provide a check-in update every public monthly meeting.  
\- Anyone involved in the network can ask to join a team (on public channels like Discord), and teams are expected to be open to new folks. Teams are self-organized and governed, but are expected to communicate on our SCN public platforms for transparency. Teams that don’t give updates or provide transparency into their activities will get their support pulled by the board.  
\- A new volunteer can sign up to champion/run a project, but in that case at least one “Lead” (any type) must be a deputy.

### Board Decision Process:

\- Monthly board meetings are open to all SCN community members, though there can also be closed meetings separately. Any decision can be made on asynchronous communications platforms (e.g. Discord or email) if deemed appropriate by the board.  
\- If a project proposal gets blocked repeatedly (3x or more), it can only be proposed again the following quarter. Or the block can be petitioned with 10+ active SCN community member signatures, presented directly to the Chair.  
\- Easy/automatic approval track: if a proposal costs $0-$50, it requires only one board member sponsor to be automatically approved. For other projects, the whole board must approve.  
\- Normal decisions: 

- First, board sponsor notifies *the whole board* of their submitted proposal (asynchronous communication such as email is fine)  
- Board consensus must be attempted within 10 days (over email/Discord is ok if it works, otherwise meeting required), or a time frame decided by the board working with the proposer  
- If still no consensus decision reached after 20 days, there must be a majority vote to resolve it  
- Unresponsive board members counted as abstain (until they are removed from the board due to unresponsiveness)

\- Rush/emergency decisions:

- Board sponsor can notify the whole board of the emergency decision (e.g. a rush repair) instead of calling a consensus decision process. Initial spending ceiling of $100 on an immediate basis, with an additional $250 spending ceiling with a one day delay/veto window to give other board members a chance to weigh in.

\- Every board decision MUST have a written record that documents the decision method and count if relevant (e.g. consensus, vote, unanimous agreement etc.) Sending an email to approve/disapprove is ok, but the written record should also be kept in an official public list/spreadsheet of approved proposals (and private list of all submitted proposals).
