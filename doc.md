# SCN Governance Structure

Motivation: To avoid coordination problems where project leaders get exhausted feeling like there’s no one to help on projects, while others (new people) feel like there’s no entry/path to helping out.

# Overall Leadership structure:

Elected leadership “Board” made up of **5**  **currently active** “*SCN* **Leads**.”  “**Currently active**” members participate with SCN at least once per quarter (every 3 months), representing consistent contribution. As of 2025, these activities can be tracked using our Netbot ticketing system. This process can be changed in the future as needed.

**Functions:**

-   
- Authorize time/resource use and spending of money  
-   
- Responsibilities detailed here: [SCN Board Roles + Sustainability Plan](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FBy6v8ySIKP0-YcYiCTp85rGGu0_rQ_XB9H17kPpwy0/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p)  
- **Projects Chair**: **maintains high quality projects/service and a good reputation for SCN in the community.**  
- **Outreach Chair**: **maintains a strong and growing volunteer base.**  
- **Documents Chair**: **maintains our docs and legal status.**  
- **Finance Chair:** **maintains our finances.**   
- **Space Chair**: **maintains the SCN Space.**

**Requirements:** 

- Default term length: one year (12 months) unless you’re on your 2nd consecutive year, in which case it’s 9 months (3 quarters), with the term limit staying at 7 consecutive quarters (you have to take 1 quarter off per 2 year period).  
- All board members MUST be responsive to email and/or Discord for decision processes (explicit abstain is acceptable if no input desired). If a board member misses 3 or more decision windows, they will be removed from the board.

## SCN Lead Requirements

Individuals must complete 10 total “Technical” and “Social” tasks to become a Lead. . An even 5/5 split is preferred, but an uneven split up to 7/3 is ok. Many activities count as both.

### **Technical Tasks:**

Technical and infrastructure projects/tasks such as installs, repairs, mentoring/teaching/leading other technical volunteers and technical projects.

Examples:  
–teaching technical skills/topics in any SCN event/workshop/class  
–site or user installs  
–repairs, expansions, upgrades  
–taking technical service/maintenance calls  
–participate in weekly community tech support

### **Social Tasks:**

*S*ocial and community organizing projects/tasks such as community meetings, outreach workshops, support calls, nonprofit administrative roles, internal governance and community building, and external community outreach. Can include hyper-local events (e.g. organizing a neighborhood or site-based meetup). This includes teaching/mentoring/leading  other social volunteers and activities.

Examples:  
–applying for a grant  
–scheduling installs/coordinating site visits  
–managing partnership with another org  
–teaching or helping to coordinate any SCN event/workshop/class  
–social media and print media for SCN  
–making forms to help organize volunteers/governance processes  
–participate in weekly community tech support

#### Process:

-   
- When you’ve done your 10+ activities, fill out a [lead certification form](https://forms.gle/whsmR31BkydWXY8d6) listing out your fulfilled tasks as a record (and get a crimp kit or other desired swag from a Board member once they approve you).  
  - [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZzrqQSJs2neDGIbqG3jRLgcTQE4TmZ3PCSkBkjdXWpQ/edit?usp=sharing) of certified SCN leads

## Board Elections:

- All Leads get to vote to elect people to the Board (and can also vote to remove a lead from the Board). Details on how all-lead decisions are made is in the below section under “All-Lead Decisions.”  
- The Documents Chair organizes agendas for community meetings. They will announce elections both on Discord and at the community meetings, and kick off the voting process at the community meetings (unless otherwise discussed). This is so that people have a chance to hear about/discuss the vote and know to pay attention to it on Discord.

## All-Lead Decisions:

- These might include but not be limited to Board Elections, Logo voting, and any other meta-level decisions that pertain to the whole volunteer base, its community representation, and its governance. Most decisions should not require an All-Lead vote.  
- **Proposed Voting processes:**   
  - **Selection Among Candidates** (e.g. Board seats, logo selection):   
    - “Thumbs up, thumbs down, abstain” voting for each Candidate. A thumbs up counts as \+1, a thumbs down counts as \-2, and no thumbs means abstain. Each Lead may give each candidate one of these types of votes.   
    - Voting should remain anonymous to everyone except to the Documents Chair who is responsible for running the vote.  
    - The candidate with the highest number of points wins.   
    - Votes for a given candidate must be at least \+5 to win, otherwise the vote fails and should be re-run at least one time.  
  - **Approval/Disapproval** (e.g. of a governance rule or document change):  
    - Approval by a simple majority (over 50%) of the currently active Leads.

## Board Decisions:

The Community Board authorizes the use of SCN resources for projects.

### Project Proposals: ([Proposal form here](https://tinyurl.com/scn-projects))

\-Projects can be proposed by anyone involved in the network (board member, volunteer, Digital Steward, partner org, user, etc.), but by default they need approval by the whole board.  
\- Every proposed project has a champion and a deputy also in our community who signs on to the project to assist. Deputy is responsible for the project in the absence of the champion. Stronger projects will have teams that include other people, not just the two required. Additionally, each proposal has a board member sponsor who presents the project to the rest of the board for approval.  
\- Info needed for proposals: Reason, timeline, budget, sign offs from required team members and board sponsor.  
\- Each project team has decision autonomy once approved, but have to provide a check-in update every public monthly meeting.  
\- Anyone involved in the network can ask to join a team (on public channels like on Discord), and teams are expected to be open to new joiners. Teams are self-organized and governed, but are expected to communicate on our SCN public platforms for transparency. Teams that don’t give updates or provide transparency into their activities will get their support revoked by the Board.  
\- A new volunteer can sign up to champion/run a project, but in that case at least one Lead must be a deputy.

### Board Decision Process:

\- Project proposals to request resource use are made to the Board on the \#scn-board-requests public channel on Discord.  Decisions can be discussed publicly or privately, on asynchronous communications platforms (e.g. Discord reaction-based approval or email) or in-person as deemed appropriate, but the decision and reasoning must be made public in a timely manner (see Normal Decisions below).  
\- If a project proposal gets blocked repeatedly (3x or more), it can only be proposed again the following quarter. Or the block can be petitioned with 10+ active SCN community member signatures, presented to the Documents Chair, after which the Board will negotiate a resolution with the petitioners. If no negotiated resolution can be reached, the decision goes to the All-Lead Decisions process.  
\- Automatic Approvals: if a proposal costs $0-$50 in total (e.g. one-time), it requires only one Board member sponsor to be automatically approved. For other projects, the whole Board must approve.  
\- Normal Decisions: 

- First, the Board sponsor makes sure to notify *the whole board* of the proposal (that means every member).  
- Board consensus must be attempted within 10 days, or a time frame decided by the board working with the proposer.  
- If still no consensus decision is reached after 20 days, there must be a simple-majority Board vote to resolve it.  
- Unresponsive board members are counted as Abstain (until they are removed from the board due to unresponsiveness).

\- Rush/emergency Decisions:

- The Board sponsor can notify the whole board of the emergency decision (e.g. a rush repair) instead of calling a consensus decision process. Initial spending ceiling of $100 on an immediate basis, with an additional $250 spending ceiling with a one day delay/veto window to give other board members a chance to weigh in.

\- Every Board decision MUST have a written record that documents the decision method and count if relevant (e.g. consensus, vote, unanimous agreement etc.) Sending an email to approve/disapprove is ok, but the written record should also be kept in an official public [list/spreadsheet of approved proposals](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_Seq5czdDK3p8TqGVfLtGXSTGqn_zOSMXLLOtCB4hiY/edit).  
\- All projects will be reviewed by the Board once a year if still ongoing one year after its start date (regardless of original timeline), and re-approved for the following year.

# Relationship Between SCN and LCL

Local Connectivity Lab (LCL) is the 501(c)(3) parent nonprofit of SCN, governed by a separate Board, and maintains the nonprofit filing status and legal compliance. As long as there is an intersecting Board member of both entities, that member is the liaison between LCL and SCN. If and when that is not the case, there will be a separate LCL Board Liaison with whom the SCN Board shall have a regular check-in at least once per quarter via synchronous or asynchronous communications. 

As written in the Chair descriptions, the Documents Chair will be the one coordinating with the LCL Board Liaison to make sure SCN’s administration needs are handled. The Finances Chair will also be responsible for reporting on SCN’s finances to LCL. If at any point LCL is not able to manage the nonprofit administration and financial responsibilities for SCN, SCN will either incorporate its own nonprofit or enter into a fiscal sponsorship relationship (for example, through OpenCollective), so that the proceeds from fiscal sponsorship can be used to support the execution of administrative responsibilities.
